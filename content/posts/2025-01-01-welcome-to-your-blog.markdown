## Getting Started

Welcome! This is a sample post to help you get started with your new blog. You can edit or delete this post and start writing your own content.

Posts are written in **Markdown**, a simple formatting language that's easy to learn. This post demonstrates various features you can use in your articles.

## Markdown Formatting

### Headings

You can create headings using the `#` symbol:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

### Text Formatting

Make text **bold** with `**bold**` or _italic_ with `*italic*`. You can also combine them: **_bold and italic_**.

Create [links](https://example.com) with `[text](url)`.

### Lists

**Unordered lists:**
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

**Ordered lists:**
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Code Blocks

Inline code uses backticks: `const example = true;`

Code blocks use triple backticks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```


### Blockquotes

> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do."
> — Steve Jobs

### Images

```markdown
![Alt text](/path/to/image.jpg)
```

### Tables
