  Prep a warm drink and put on some soft music! I’ll guide you step by step to create a beautiful static site with Roq, leveraging the comfort of Quarkus Dev Mode. We’ll start with the page layout, then add a responsive menu, multiple pages, and a blog section. With TailwindCSS for styling—including dark/light mode and full responsiveness—your site will look delightful without much effort.

Prep a warm drink and put on some soft music, in this tutorial, we’ll show you how to create a modern static website using Roq — a powerful new tool that combines Java, Quarkus, and TailwindCSS. You’ll build a site with a responsive menu, a stunning hero section, and an article listing, all while enjoying the simplicity and speed of static site generation. Let’s make coding cozy and future-ready!

## Setup

Make sure you have the JDK 17+ on your machine and install the [Quarkus CLI](https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling) to makes things smoother:
```
curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - trust add https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/quarkus/quarkus-cli/
curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - app install --fresh --force quarkus@quarkusio
```

**NOTE:** We started working on a Quarkus Wrapper to allow starting dev-mode and soon also editor mode without anything to install on the machine.

**TIP:** You can optionally install [Quarkus IDE tooling](https://quarkus.io/guides/ide-tooling) to make the xp even smoother. 

I cooked a starter repo with Quarkus, Roq and Tailwind as pom.xml dependencies and the very base of your next website:
```shell
# Clone the starter repo (or download):
git clone ...
cd ...
```

You should be all set for the whole journey 👌

What did I clone 🤨?

├── config/application.properties # Site config

```

Let's start Quarkus Dev-Mode:
```
quarkus dev
```

When Quarkus is started, yeah... well... after downloading a bunch of dependencies 😅 (just the first time), press `w` on you keyboard and let the magic happen!
